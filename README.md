# hello-world

Hi, Jeeyoon here. I am going to be an aspiring hospitality designer. I am very much intrested in the arts and design world. 
I also love culinary delights, and a coffee drinker and bread-lover. 
I love travelling as well. My goals this year is to be able to code well and get some experience in freelance work in front end development. I hope it will take me anywhere in the world.
I want to be a digital nomad before turning 30. I am still 26, so it is a fairly achievable dream. Don't you think? 
I want to travel around the world and get inspiration and start my own interior design practice focusing on hospitality design.
